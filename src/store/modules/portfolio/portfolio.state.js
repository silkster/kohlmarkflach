      <p>There's something about Charlottesville. Once you've lived here, walked the Lawn, and seen the Blue Ridge, you're part of a community, and you'll always be able to call this place home. It's a story we hear from so many clients. They came back to raise a family. They came back for retirement. Or they never left. They feel a connection to Virginia, to Charlottesville, and to the red brick, the standing seam, the rustic barn, or the front porch. The enduring architecture that dots our landscape is part of the experience. It's a unique blend of southern gentility, rural vernacular style, and local creative initiative.</p>
      <p>In the Spring of 2020, a new client reached out to us with a familiar vision. They'd bought a farm west of town. They wanted to turn it into a "generational property." Somewhere their family could always call home.</p>
      <p>It just so happened that their new farm was already a generational property for <a href="https://www.alexandernicholson.com/" target="_blank">Alexander Nicholson</a>. Thirty years ago, our founders added a farm manager's apartment onto an old horse barn set in the rolling hills of the property.</p>
      <p><b>Now, the new owners saw potential in the original section of the  barn.</b >With a little work, they knew it could be a gathering place for their grown children and extended family - a place to drink, eat, sleep, read, and be together for the holidays. In this new golden age of Virginia libations, party barns and event barns are de rigueur - Alexander Nicholson has built several - but this would be our most ambitious barn conversion yet. The clients were passionate about preserving the historic character and rustic feel of the barn while seamlessly integrating luxurious finishes, light-filled spaces, and modern amenities.</p>
      <p>When an owner has such a bold vision - that creative spark so often found in Charlottesville - the selection of a good architect is imperative. Design professionals partner with you to capture your dreams, and partner with us to bring them to fruition. For this project, the owners selected Tom Flach of <a href="/leadership">Kohlmark Flach Architects</a> - someone we hadn't worked with before. With creative input from the owners every step of the way, Tom drew brilliant plans for a restored barn with hidden rooms, salvaged wood, and dramatic expanses of glass. There would be a room for whiskey, a room for wine, and room for the whole family to gather.</p>
      <p>Such a detailed project demanded skilled hands and traditional construction experience; we brought in <a href="https://www.alexandernicholson.com/team" target="_blank">Garrett Irwin</a> as Superintendent and <a href="https://www.alexandernicholson.com/team" target="_blank">Max Henderson</a> as Project Manager. Garrett is a master carpenter and conscientious team leader. Max has a lifetime of experience managing the construction of homes in Virginia. Together, they helped guide the owners through the entire renovation process. For Garrett and Max, every detail had to exceed the owner's expectations, as well as those they set for themselves.</p>
      <p><b>The project started with an entire week of concrete demolition.</b>Garrett and his team took three hour shifts on the jackhammer, removing an 8-inch thick slab of concrete on the ground floor. Next came the careful removal of the original siding, as well as the 1¾" thick oak boards that lined the interior of the barn. We saved both for re-use. With the barn down to its frame, we could fully assess its structural integrity.</p>
      <p>As with any historic building, oddities and out-of-date building techniques had to be sympathetically addressed. With the help of Steve Barber of <a href="https://dmwpv.com/" target="_blank">DMWPV Engineers</a>, we removed and replaced both gable ends of the barn, and reframed the entire second floor hayloft to create the family's new gathering space. A structural collar was added, belting in the weight of the new second floor. Structural beams and columns were installed to make way for massive new window openings.</p>
      <p>With the barn stabilized, cleaned, and inspected, it was time for the owners' vision to come to life. New glass entry doors let light in from each end of the barn, which is refracted through the dark bars and beams of the original horse stalls. We poured and polished a new concrete slab on the first floor - a classed-up homage to the original. The entryway opens into a hallway of original horse stalls, which define the new floor plan. To the left, a floating stairway is made from massive reclaimed wooden beams. Above, the original hay bale loft was repurposed as a balcony, complete with its original bale lift pulley as a decorative element.</p>
      <p>Down the hall and behind an original sliding door, one horse stall became a whiskey room. It features a copper sink, copper shelving, and a private bar built from reclaimed wood. Opposite is the "tack room," an elegant restroom with equestrian inspiration and custom cabinetry built from more reclaimed wood. In the back, there's a guest bedroom with bunks made from salvaged structural beams, closets behind hidden doors, and a wine cellar in the hallway. Throughout the entire first floor, walls are covered with the thick oak boards we salvaged at the beginning of the project. Instead of putting them back exactly as we found them, we flipped them over, concealing the worn, painted, horse-kicked side and revealing beautiful raw patinated wood that'd been preserved behind the wall for 70 years.</p>
      <p>On the second floor, the dark, whiskey-tinged tones of aged wood give way to a bright, airy living loft with space for the entire family. White clapboards cover the walls and roof eaves. It's a dramatically light-filled room interspersed with rustic details. Reclaimed floors from The Heartpine Company match a few original structural timbers at the edges of the space. The entire loft is open, flowing out into the landscape at each gable-end through massive arched windows.</p>
      <p>Under one roof eave, facing you as you reach the top of the stairs, there's a lush kitchen in shades of white, cream, and gold. Beyond the antique dining table in the center of the room, a wood stove and small sitting area are tucked into a triple dormer window. On the opposite side, two sets of French doors open onto a pair of crows-nest balconies that overlook the property. Between the two balconies is one of the owner's most ingenious ideas: a jewel-box powder room disguised as a fresh stack of birch firewood.</p>
      <p>For a single open loft, the owner and architect managed to create intimate spaces for every family member and for every situation. Refuge from the weather by a fire, outlook over the landscape, tucked-away nooks for reading, and the reassuring feeling of being sheltered by the strong, traditional frame of the barn roof. Combined with the highly detailed first floor, the space offers a rich experience for an individual or a large group. It demands that time be spent exploring and enjoying the architecture and the land. It's a fitting landmark on a property that the family hopes to always call home.</p>
      <p>Every detail of this project required the exacting attention of our team and our subcontractors. Unusual materials, tight spaces, complicated framing, and massive windows made for daily challenges and daily rewards for everyone involved. We are proud of our work, stand by our craftsmanship, and wish the family generations spent together in their beautiful barn.</p>
      <p>As a Charlottesville community builder, we are passionate about creating special spaces for local families. If you're interested in starting your own project, please reach out to us. We'd be honored to help you every step of the way.</p>

      <p>The owners of this historic farmhouse sought a comprehensive addition to expand the living and entertaining spaces while bringing the family together with a more open, fluid and friendly layout.</p>
      <p>The small rooms, low ceilings and dark, interior kitchen have given way to open spaces, vaulted ceilings and a spectacular relocated kitchen. A floor-to-ceiling folding door opens the entire great room to the outdoors while the visually stunning timber frame trusses support the vaulted ceiling and hint to the traditional barn on site.</p>
      <p>The original breezeway that connected the garage to the house was rarely used so a new central foyer was designed in its place. The wide entrance offers great views of the pool, pool house and farm while drawing people into the new entertaining spaces.</p>
      <p>Use of shiplap siding on the walls, tongue & groove ceilings, recessed lighting and wide-plank white oak floors give the entire space a fresh look.</p>
      <p>Great care was taken to expand the home without diminishing its historic charm or period details. The soffits, fascia, clapboard siding and windows seamlessly integrate with the original home. Colonial windows were replaced with “farm style” 2/2 windows for a more traditional look and exterior barn lights are an authentic touch consistent with those used on the detached barn and adjacent pool house.</p>
      <p>All this work was not without its challenges. The older additions were not properly aligned with the original dwelling, so floors needed to be elevated and leveled. All work was done while three adults, two kids and two dogs occupied the home. This meant building the new addition and kitchen had to occur prior to removing the old kitchen.</p>

      <p>The design of this home was driven by the owners' desire for a three-bedroom waterfront home that showcased the spectacular views and park-like setting. As nature lovers, they wanted their home to be organic, minimize any environmental impact on the sensitive site and embrace nature.</p>
      <p>This unique home is sited on a high ridge with a 45° slope to the water on the right and a deep ravine on the left. The five-acre site is completely wooded and tree preservation was a major emphasis. Very few trees were removed and special care was taken to protect the trees and environment throughout the project. To further minimize disturbance, grades were not changed and the home was designed to take full advantage of the site's natural topography. Oak from the home site was re-purposed for the mantle, powder room counter and select furniture.</p>
      <p>The visually powerful <a href="https://www.finehomebuilding.com/2015/11/11/parallel-parking" target="_blank">twin pavilions</a> were born from the need for level ground and parking on an otherwise challenging site. Fill dirt excavated from the main home provided the foundation. All structures are anchored with a natural stone base and exterior materials include timber framing, fir ceilings, shingle siding, a partial metal roof and corten steel walls. Stone, wood, metal and glass transition the exterior to the interior and large wood windows flood the home with light and showcase the setting. Interior finishes include reclaimed heart pine floors, Douglas fir trim, dry-stacked stone, rustic cherry cabinets and soapstone counters.</p>
      <p>Exterior spaces include a timber-framed porch, stone patio with fire pit and commanding views of the Occoquan reservoir. A second porch overlooks the ravine and a breezeway connects the garage to the home.</p>
      <p>Numerous energy-saving features have been incorporated, including LED lighting, on-demand gas water heating and special insulation. Smart technology helps manage and control the entire house.</p>

      <p>The Owners of this riverfront property requested a home that was designed to showcase the spectacular setting while remaining comfortable for large parties or just two people. Every major room features magnificent water views and the generous use of rich woods, stone, color and scale create warm and inviting spaces despite the size.</p>
      <p>High winds, humidity, and intense reflective sun are some of the unique challenges of living on the river and needed to be addressed. To overcome these, tinted windows, spray foam insulation, whole house radiant heat, and VRF cooling were incorporated to make the house energy efficient and comfortable year round.</p>

      <p>Ensconced in a neighborhood with its own wooded trail leading down to the C&amp;O Canal towpath, the owners and their three young boys adored their pristine surroundings. If only their 1980s Colonial home shared a similar reverence for Mother Nature. Its windows were too few and far between to appreciate the views. Outdated mechanical systems and poor insulation made the house drafty and inefficient. It also had an outdated kitchen and disjointed floor plan.</p>
      <p>House-hunting forays to find something better led to a simple realization: No other lot in the Metro area could hold a candle to their Potomac gem. So they decided to stay put, and commissioned KohlMark Group to design a renovation—which eventually evolved into the design of a brand new house.</p>
      <p>Unencumbered by the constraints of the original structure, the architect and his clients were free to explore bold new options. They set their sights on a modern home with an open floor plan that would celebrate nature, accommodate parties of all sizes, and project sophisticated style without sacrificing comfort or durability.</p>
      <p>Faced with a limited footprint on the two-acre lot, the home was nestled around the existing pool without disturbing the mature river birches in the front yard. The home's southern orientation made solar power an easy option—happily for the owners, whose determination to tread lightly on the environment drove the entire building process. Before demolition, Second Chance, a Baltimore non-profit, deconstructed the original house—and was able to recycle two-thirds of its materials. The owners selected insulated low-E, argon-filled windows; spray-foam insulation; low-voltage and LED lighting and low-flow and dual-flush plumbing fixtures for maximum efficiency. The solar system fuels electricity and hot water.</p>
      <p>But going sustainable did not mean settling for spartan over über-chic. In fact, many of the home's features required daring feats of engineering, from walls of glass to a three-level cantilevered, helical staircase to an open "fire pit" hearth in the living room that appears to defy gravity. The walls were painted white to allow the home's organic materials—Brazilian cherry floors, stone and glass—and the views to take center stage.</p>
      <p>Voluminous and intimate rooms on the main level yield to a second-story "bridge" connecting the bedrooms. By contrast, dark gray dining room takes on a glamorous vibe thanks to the crystal pendants by Schonbek.</p>
      <p>The living room is oriented toward the outside with a two-story wall of glass. A custom rug mimics the line of the ceiling above, and a series of wall sculptures by John Douglas makes a bold statement. The living room leads to a loggia, where a NanaWall opens completely to face the backyard.</p>
      <p>Public and private "zones" cater to both family and social functions. A pocket door closes off the kitchen, family room and family powder room, and a back stairway and elevator lead upstairs so the kids can use these spaces during a party—sight and sound unseen.</p>
      <p>The wife, an expert cook, immersed herself in the kitchen design with help from kitchen designer Patty Whitman. Double ovens, sinks, microwaves and dishwashers make the space functional, while Bianco Antico granite countertops and a white back-painted glass backsplash offset dark cabinets and wood floors. In the adjacent family room, oversized windows flank a stucco-clad fireplace.</p>
      <p>The master suite, positioned on one side of the bridge above the loggia with the boys' rooms on the other, is a picture of serenity. Inspired by a hotel the couple visited in Mexico, the bathroom pampers them with smooth limestone and marble tiles and a soaking tub with views of the treetops.</p>
      <p>The second floor also features rooms with en suite baths for each son, a well-appointed guest suite and a kids' gallery where the parents and boys gather to read and unwind before bedtime. A large third-story playroom prevents toys from straying into other areas of the house.</p>
      <p>On the lower level, the owners have created a sophisticated "club room." Unlike their previously dark basement, the new space is bathed in light thanks to the open staircase and bridge near the fireplace. An indoor-outdoor bar, a modular sofa and an etched stainless-steel wall sculpture make this space perfect for large gatherings. A whole-house Lutron lighting system and wireless sound system by SONOS enable the owners to set moods with ease. The lower level also features an exercise room and a bathroom with a steam shower.</p>

      <p>Our clients saw potential in this worn out post and beam house on a dramatic steep site. The previous owners had raised seven children in the house and everything from the kitchen cabinets, to the doors, to the bathrooms needed to be replaced. However, the location on a hillside above the Potomac River with 4 stories of glass walled views provided inspiration for the restoration. The house is entered from the street on the third level with one level above and 2 levels below. This created a challenge to reassign awkward spaces and distinguish between public and private spaces while maximizing views from important rooms. The goal was to transform this worn out house with lower end finishes and fixtures into a state of the art piece of modern design with full security, whole house audio and cat5 networking. The post and beam design with lock deck floors and ceilings allowed no chases or space between floors. Particular attention had to be given to relocating plumbing and mechanical as well as wiring for whole house audio.</p>
      <p>In addition, the entire project had to be designed, permitted, and built in six months. At a certain point in the project, the painters lived in the house and took breaks only to eat and sleep in sleeping bags on the floor. Some long lead items had to be ordered before the architectural drawings were even completed.</p>
      <p>All interior doors and trim were removed and replaced with natural maple one panel doors offset by very minimalist mahogany base and casing. The contrast of the natural maple and dark mahogany was meant to complement and update the existing dark beams and wood ceilings. Carpet was replaced with environmentally friendly bamboo flooring. The outdated kitchen suffered from low dark ceilings and poor florescent lighting. To visually raise the ceilings, the beams were painted white, and cable track lighting was installed up and between the beams. African slate flooring was installed throughout the foyer and kitchen to complement the bamboo flooring in the great room and dining room. The library and a guest bedroom were reconfigured and added to the small master bedroom to create a grand master suite with closet systems and a fireplace.</p>
      <p>The house suffered from one major traffic flow and design issue involving the foyer and main stair. Upon entering the house, the view was blocked and the foyer was cramped by a large stair. By relocating the stair to the endwall of the great room, the foyer was opened to the view, and the stair became a design opportunity. A custom designed maple and mahogany stair serves as a sculptural element on what was a blank wall at the end of the great room. A floor to ceiling glass panel was added at the bottom of the stairs to take advantage of hidden views of the river. A spiral staircase was added to the solarium to provide public circulation from the living room above without needing to pass through the master bedroom below.</p>

      <p>It's all about location and the owners of this dated 1990s colonial purchased the home for its spectacular views and setting. Unfortunately, the design of the existing home did not live up to its potential. An awkwardly placed mudroom blocked an otherwise magnificent view from the existing kitchen and breakfast room while the second floor turned its back on the amazing high views of the vineyard and mountains beyond. The unfinished basement did little to connect with the beautiful rear yard and the “builder grade” windows and exterior materials were at the end of their useful life.</p>
      <p>A rear two-story addition created special spaces on each level. On the second floor, the master suite was expanded to create a retreat in the sky with glass on all sides. On the first floor, a new large mud room with dog shower and a larger open breakfast area created a functional space that maximized the views. In addition, a new deck and stair connects the house to the yard and the new pool and spa. The new basement includes all of the spaces required for entertaining including a billiards area, home office, media room and wet bar. In addition, a covered lower outdoor entertainment area with a two sided fireplace connects the indoors and the outdoors.</p>
      <p>To complete the transformation, all new windows, siding, roof, and a front porch changed the tired colonial into a modern farmhouse with black windows and white board and batten siding. A new window design in the great room completed the transformation and maximized the views. The new front porch provides a more welcome entrance and a new space for relaxing and connecting with the outdoors.</p>

      <p>This horse country estate has a rich history tracing back to 1790. In the 1920’s, noted architect William Bottomley expanded the simple structure into a magnificent stone hunting lodge. However, in recent times, the house was unoccupied and fell into disrepair. Our clients purchased the structure with the goal of transforming the home into a summer retreat suited for large gatherings while still preserving the historic character and exterior of the home. The restoration involved complete new mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems as well as redesign of the spaces to accommodate a young family and their visitors.</p>
      <p>The original kitchen and garage wing were completely transformed into a new open kitchen, great room and laundry space. The courtyard wall of the garage was removed and replaced with large swinging glass panels. The panels are salvaged from an old factory in Philadelphia and transformed into a glass wall that can be completely opened to the courtyard in the summer.</p>
      <p>Original features such as the hand painted murals, gold leaf dome ceiling, woodwork and phone booth were restored or repurposed to serve the current needs of the client while retaining the historic artifacts.</p>
      <p>The floor plan was reimagined to create intimate spaces for the family and additional rooms to accommodate a large number of weekend visitors or parties. The right wing includes 3 bedrooms, the master suite and an informal kitchen, breakfast area and great room. What was originally a series of small rooms was reimagined as this space for the family to gather on weekends. The central wing includes the original parlor, a large formal dining room and a billiards space. The attic was converted into a bunk room for visitors. The second floor servant’s quarters was removed to create a dramatic dining space with cathedral ceilings.</p>
      <p>With respect for the historic significance of the structure, the home has been transformed and preserved to serve the needs of future generations.</p>

      <p>This 1980's contemporary had great curb appeal and proportions, but contained many awkward and poorly designed spaces. While the primary focus was to address the design deficiencies with additions and a more livable and useful floor plan, extensive work was done to transform the interior and exterior into a more traditional craftsman-style cottage.</p>
      <p>The addition to the right of the house addressed the need for a main level garage with an in-law suite above. By moving the garage out of the basement, space became available for a billiard room and allowed the lower level to open to the rear yard. The laundry was relocated to the addition, and the old dark kitchen was expanded and relocated to the outside corner walls to allow for more windows and natural light.</p>
      <p>A rear addition expanded the dining room to a more suitable size for entertaining and increased the size of a small second floor bedroom. The third addition created a sitting room and transformed the long, narrow and small master bedroom into a well-proportioned and inviting master suite.</p>
      <p>The exterior was in reasonable good shape. The stone and cedar siding were in excellent condition, but the windows needed to be replaced. Through careful design, new windows, and modifications to the cornice and rake details, the very dated 1980s exterior was transformed into the storybook cottage you see today.</p>
      <p>To complete the transformation, all interior birch veneer doors and trim were replaced with traditional raised panel doors and generous colonial baseboard. Originally drywall, the stair well and foyer now feature wrought iron railings, oak wainscoting and recessed oak panels. Even the ceilings received attention. The once textured ceilings are now smooth. The kitchen and bathrooms were all renovated and updated.</p>

      <p>The existing three-bedroom home was originally constructed as a carriage house to serve a future estate and never intended to be a primary residence. Though full of charm, the small place lacked the space and functionality typically found in today's homes. With a growing family and defined limitations, the long-time owners wanted to remodel and expand.</p>
      <p>We were asked to design a new foyer, living room and master suite with adjacent study above grade and incorporate an exercise room and unfinished workspace in the basement. A constant consideration throughout the design process was to make sure all work seamlessly integrated with the original stone house. Equally challenging and important to the design was the home's location at the bottom of a steep rural site. A large swale located directly adjacent to the existing residence acted as a natural watershed for a large portion of the property. To address and overcome this challenge, we designed the living room as a bridge, literally spanning the existing swale and joining the carriage house with the new master bedroom wing.</p>
      <p>The final design incorporates a stone gatehouse with a copper standing-seam roof to act as the new foyer and features a cathedral ceiling with exposed beams. The adjacent living room bridges the carriage house with the new master bedroom wing and features the same cathedral ceiling and exposed beams found in the foyer. Abundant windows flood the space with light and the exposed stone and honey-colored hardwood floors create warmth.</p>
      <p>Outside, the entire master bedroom wing is constructed with stone that is a near perfect match to the original carriage house. A new deck with direct access to the living room runs from the entry foyer gatehouse to the master bedroom wing and features a delicate stainless steel cable rail system that maximizes visibility. The existing motor court was utilized as the patio for the front entry foyer and special lighting was incorporated to accent the entire home.</p>

      <p>Modernism and traditionalism are just steps away from each other at thisVienna Virginia pool house. The main house, built by another nationalhomebuilder, draws upon tradition, but the pool house, speaks the languageof contemporary minimalism. It presents clean lines and a soaring rooflineoverhanging tall glass doors and clerestory windows. Great design, carefulattention to detail, first-rate materials and impeccable craftsmanshiphave yielded a spectacular solution for outdoor entertaining. With afireplace and every conceivable convenience under roof, this pool housemight just be the perfect escape for inclement weather as well.</p>
      <p>The pool house was designed with a simple elongated plan parallel to thepool and side yard fence, maximizing the view and parental control of theoutdoor patio and pool from the existing home (as desired by the owners).A simple shed roof was utilized to create the contemporary spaces and openthe pool house to both the yard and pool. Simple contemporary cabinetswere used in the kitchen, while the interior was organized to accommodatethe wishes of the clients and maintain views of the yard from all of thespaces. Carefully selected lighting was used throughout the project tocreate special effects in the evening and the same travertine that wasused for the pool deck was incorporated in the pool house in order to tiethe pool house to the surrounding landscape as desired.</p>

      <p>Tom and Nancy Stout have always loved hosting parties, but it wasn't easy in the Oakton home they shared for 18 years, where typical gatherings of extended family and friends meant moving furniture and setting out multiple coolers. "Neither one of us wanted to leave Oakton," Nancy says, but the spread they envisioned didn't seem possible in an established suburb.</p>
      <p>Serendipity struck one day in 2013 when Nancy came across a lot for sale that backed up to Fairfax County parkland. The owner lived on the adjacent lot—and promised to sell them her remaining parcel when she retired.</p>
      <p>They waited two years to acquire the second lot that gave them two acres of forest-lined land, all the while assembling ideas for their new home and party compound—and the team to make it happen. "They had a unique opportunity to do something really special," says their architect, Tom Flach.</p>
      <p>High on the Stouts' wish list was a pool and pool house, a spacious screened porch and a lower-level play space for all ages complete with table games, a sophisticated wine room, a bar and a golf-simulation center—a top priority for Tom Stout, a former corporate controller for AOL.</p>
      <p>In his plan, Flach set out to relate the home to the context of the neighborhood and provide visual and physical connections to the landscape. Meeting his clients' requirement for plenty of entertaining space, he says, "The challenge was creating a house that was comfortable for two people but scalable for 20 to stay over—or a party for 100." Despite the home's 11,800-square-foot size, he designed clearly defined public rooms that don't feel cavernous when visitors are not around and a master wing on the main level that serves as the Stouts' private retreat.</p>
      <p>The overall architecture was influenced by both Shingle-style and Arts and Crafts abodes. "I find inspiration in the material palette, the complex roof lines and the scale of these homes," says Flach. "I wanted the house to evoke memories of more traditional homes while feeling comfortable in a suburban neighborhood."</p>
      <p>Interior designer Sandra Meyers came on board early to ensure that everything from the interior architecture to the furnishings and décor suited the couple's aesthetic. "They wanted a casual but sophisticated house," she explains. "Everything is user-friendly, everything is easy—and coming to visit for the weekend is like going to a resort."</p>
      <p>Meyers chose elements that are attractive yet durable, such as distressed-finish cabinetry and stain-resistant fabrics. The Stouts had asked for a mostly gray palette, but Meyers broke it up with shots of black and white. Wood and <a href="https://www.homeanddesign.com/resources/listing/heritage-metalworks" target="_blank">heritage metalworks</a> imparted warmth and a sense of timelessness. She selected walnut ceiling beams and built-in shelving to add character to the family room and chose exposed-steel I-beams instead of drywall on structural-support columns in the basement. "When you mix materials," the designer comments, "it creates longevity that you don't get when you walk one style line."</p>
      <p>If one color stands out from the mix, it's the teal cabinetry in the pantry at the heart of the main level—easily accessible from every interior space and the outdoor grilling area. "It's basically a Tiffany box," says Nancy Stout, a former member of AOL's marketing team. Since the pantry is so central, it allowed Meyers to extend shades of teal and turquoise outward into the kitchen's seating area, on accent pillows in the family room and onto the dining-room rug.</p>
      <p>Also critical to the design was maintaining a seamless transition between indoors and out. Flach worked closely with landscape architect Howard Cohen to achieve that goal. "It's one of the most comprehensive processes I've ever gone through for a landscape," Cohen reports, noting that his team helped site the house and engineered grading on the property in addition to designing the pool house and pool. "The landscape is in scale with the house," he says. "You want the house to have a nice presence on its site."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, builder Arjay West found a way to make Nancy's beloved screened porch an integral part of its surroundings: Both motor-controlled screens and clear vinyl panels designed for cooler weather roll up to create a covered terrace that perches over the pool. Beside it, a picturesque fountain sends water running down over a black-granite boulder. "The porch might be Nancy's favorite space," West says. "It really can be a four-season room—we installed infrared heaters on three sides and electric floor heat."</p>
      <p>West takes pride in the quality of the home's construction, noting small details that have big impact such as the slender steel collar ties supporting the pitched roof in the master-suite library, which appear as decorative metal rods in the wood-paneled ceiling. The wine room's glass wall panels were embedded in the floor and ceiling to avoid visible tracks or brackets. And when closed, a sliding door to the master bathroom is indistinguishable from the bedroom's wall paneling. "It's the most complete and fantastic project I've ever been involved with," West says.</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, the energy-efficient home boasts an extensive, remote-controlled network of lighting, sound and video systems both inside and out. Says Atlantic Multimedia principal Thomas Rogers, who installed the system, "There's a lot of electronics and engineering in this house that you don't notice."</p>
      <p>In fact, all the Stouts notice these days is their ease of living and entertaining—whether it's family gatherings at holiday time, when 20 or more spend the weekend, or their grandchildren's basketball and soccer team parties. "We keep telling everyone, ‘Yes, we'll host your party,'" says Nancy. "That's our purpose in life!"</p>
