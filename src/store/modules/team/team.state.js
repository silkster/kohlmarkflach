      <p>Growing up in Pittsburgh, PA, the son of an engineer, Tom spent his summers working in the drafting department and visiting construction sites with his Dad. These experiences helped shape his early interest in architecture. While earning undergraduate degrees in Economics and Psychology from Vanderbilt University, Tom would spend hours at the library exploring the works of Louis Kahn, Le Corbusier, Robert Stern, and others. But it was a class he took his senior year, The History of Modern Architecture, that would be the catalyst to change course and pursue a Master of Architecture degree from Virginia Tech.</p>
      <p>A consummate perfectionist with a deep knowledge of architectural styles and influences, Tom spent 20 years as the former Vice President for one of the area's top design/build companies before launching Kohlmark Flach Architects in 2015.</p>
      <p>An outdoor enthusiast, and world traveler, Tom cherishes family above all else. When he's not working, running, biking, hiking, skiing, traveling, or hanging with the family, Tom dreams about designing and building his own piece of paradise in the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
      <p>A recipient of numerous awards, Tom is a distinguished member of the <a href="https://www.aia.org" target="_blank">American Institute of Architects</a> (AIA) and licensed in Virginia.</p>

      <p>With parents who built a house in rural Maine and an uncle who is a woodworker, Jeremy was destined for a career in building. Inspired by his childhood experiences, Jeremy pursued engineering at Hobart College until exposure to fine art classes cemented his passion for architecture. After graduating with distinction, Jeremy went on to receive a Master of Architecture degree from the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
      <p>As a hands-on architect with a reputation as a collaborative designer, Jeremy is focused on the expression of materials and experiences over the limits of traditional construction. His designs are clean, ordered and a refreshing departure from the faux colonial homes that dominate the region.</p>
      <p>Outside of the office, Jeremy enjoys mountain biking, cooking, making furniture and time with his family.</p>
      <p>Jeremy is a distinguished member of the <a href="https://www.aia.org" target="_blank">American Institute of Architects</a> (AIA) and licensed in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p>Another Pennsylvania native, Chris's early inspiration for building and creating stemmed from countless hours in his father's woodshop. His exposure to woodworking, along with his love of math and geometry, seemed ideally suited to the pursuit of architecture.</p>
      <p>Throughout high school and college, Chris worked construction, learning skills and trades that shaped his understanding of how houses come together. The knowledge gained during those years have made Chris a better designer and enable him to handle all construction needs on his historic home in downtown Leesburg.</p>
      <p>Despite his historic dwelling, Chris has always been drawn to clean, modern architecture and looks forward to designing and building his own home in the future.</p>
      <p>Chris still enjoys woodworking and has built nearly all his home furnishings. He volunteers with <a href="https://makersmiths.org" target="_blank">Makersmiths</a> as a shop steward, teaching woodworking and maintaining the wood shop in Leesburg. Away from the sawdust and tools, Chris can be found cycling the gravel of Loudoun County and traveling to mountain bike trails throughout the region.</p>
      <p>Chris holds a degree in Architecture from Virginia Tech.</p>

      <p>A native of Bradford, Pennsylvania, Tracey was surrounded by the natural beauty of the Allegheny National Forest and historic treasures like the Dresser Mansion, Glendorn and countless others on the National Register of Historic Places. The early exposure to architectural styles, spectacular gardens, manicured grounds and natural environment were clear influences on her educational and career path.</p>
      <p>Initially enrolled in Architectural Engineering at Penn State University, Tracey's blended interests in design, science and sociology were better suited to a degree in Landscape Architecture and nurtured her interest in designing outdoor spaces and planning new communities and built environments. Since then, Tracey has transitioned into her current role as manager of the firm's business and financial operations.</p>
      <p>A consummate professional, Tracey's communication and organizational skills are second only to her infectious smile and quick wit.</p>
      <p>Tracey juggles work life with yoga, walking her dogs, spending time with family, and planning trips abroad. She's an accomplished baker too, making some of the finest breads you'll ever taste.</p>
